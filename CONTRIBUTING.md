### Git workflow

We use a simplified workflow inspired by GitHub Flow:

- All work happens in separate branches created from `main`.
- Branch names are chosen freely (`front`, `back`, `db`, etc.).
- Issues are created using templates:  
  [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE):  
	- [User Story  ](https://github.com/S25-SWP-Team46/DP-fork/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/backlog-bug-report.yml)
	- [Bug Report](https://github.com/S25-SWP-Team46/DP-fork/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/backlog-user-story.yml)
	- [Technical Task](https://github.com/S25-SWP-Team46/DP-fork/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/task.yml)
   
	and labels:  
	- `enhancement` — new functionality 
	- `User Story` — new functionality from the customers view
	- `bug` — defect reports  
	- `wontfix` — suggestions to improvement
	- `release` — end point of some functionality or task
	- `good first issue` - if it is necessary to start do some actions, but PM do not knows which exactly, because of it is not his own area of knowledges  
	Assignment policy:
		The issue author assigns the issue to the developer responsible, or to the team lead if unassigned. Assigns must acknowledge ownership by leaving a comment within 24 hours.
- Commit messages must be clear and reference issues if needed.
- When work is done:
  - Push your branch.
  - Create a Pull Request to `main` using the template: 
  - [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
  - Request a review.
- Review policy: global merge requests approving by customer's review
- Merge only after approvals and passing tests in `main`.
- Close related issues after merging and delete branch.
